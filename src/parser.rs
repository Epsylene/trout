use crate::token::Token;

// The job of the scanner (or lexer) is to take a string of
// characters and convert it into a series of tokens. The job
// of the parser is to take a series of tokens and build an AST
// from it. There is a large number of different parser
// families, depending on the scanning or derivation strategy:
// top-down (start at the top grammar rule and work all the way
// to the leaves) or bottom-up (construct the sintax from ever
// larger combinations of primary expressions), leftmost
// derivation or rightmost derivation (which nonterminal to
// rewrite at each step)... Some known types of parsers are the
// LL(k) (top-down, leftmost, with k tokens of lookahead),
// LR(k) (bottom-up, righmost, with k tokens of lookahead),
// LALR (a LR(0) coupled with one token of lookahead, which is
// simpler and more efficient than a LR(1)), the Earley parser
// (top-down dynamic programming algorithm), the shunting yard
// algorithm (process the elements one symbol at a time,
// letting through literals and pushing operators on a separate
// stack, then popping when an operator with a lower precedence
// is pushed or there is nothing left), or the Packrate parser
// (which takes PEGs, parsing expression grammars, rather than
// LL grammars).
//
// We will use a recursive descent parser, which is the
// simplest way of traversing the sintax tree, translating each
// rule of the grammar into a function. To avoid ambiguity in
// expressions such as "1 * 2 / 3", we first need to define the
// precedence and associativity of each operator, such that
// from highest to lowest precedence:
// (1) Unary operators (! -) associate right;
// (2) Factor (* /) associate left;
// (3) Term (+ -) associate left;
// (4) Comparison (< > <= >=) associate left;
// (5) Equality (== !=) associate left.
// 
// To be able to "read" the precedence while parsing the
// grammar, we need to write it so that each rule matches
// expressions at a precedence level equal or higher to the
// previous one. In the end, we get:
//
//  expression := equality
//  equality   := comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )*
//  comparison := term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )*
//  term       := factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )*
//  factor     := unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )*
//  unary      := ( "!" | "-" ) unary | primary
//  primary    := NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" | "(" expression ")"
//
// Lastly, note that there is no left-recursion in the grammar
// (rules in the form "s := s ..."), which we would not be able
// to parse without entering an infinite recursive loop.
